# Simple Calculator (Python CLI)

A command-line calculator built in Python as part of my journey to becoming a **Python Backend Engineer**.

This project consolidates core Python fundamentals into a single, structured program and follows backend-style design principles such as separation of concerns and clean control flow.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Continuous program execution using a controlled loop
- Supports basic arithmetic operations:
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
  - Division
- Clean exit option
- Graceful handling of:
  - Invalid menu choices
  - Non-numeric input
  - Division by zero
- Dictionary-based operation dispatch (no long `if/else` chains)

---

## 🧠 Concepts Demonstrated

- Functions and return values
- `while True` loops with `break` and `continue`
- Dictionary usage (`key → function` mapping)
- Input validation using `try / except`
- Clean, readable program structure

These concepts form the foundation of backend development in Python.
